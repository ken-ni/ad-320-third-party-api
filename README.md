### API USED: https://api.seriesquotes.10cyrilc.me/docs#/

## Documentation and setup instructions
Download the HTML file and run it in a browser. Click on the button to generate random movie quotes.

## API Selection
I chose an API that contains quotes from random series and movies.

## Application Concept
The concept of my application is really simple, it grabs the quotes given from the API and displays it on the webpage. Initially I wanted to create a minigame where the user would guess which movie/show the quote came from, but I wasn't quite successful with that.

## Application Development
Some of the quotes/authors that the API provided were improperly formatted, so I created a few filters which made the data presented cleaner to the user.

## Documentation and Testing
My application is really simple and is only based on the button that generates quotes, so there's not much testing to be done in this case. It does handle me pressing the button many times quite well though.

## Write up
I used the "Web Series Quotes API". It pulls quotes from the API and works by allowing the user to click the button to pull as many quotes as they desire. When developing this small application, I had trouble with validating user inputs and saving scores, so I just simplified it to be a website that generates quotes.
